              The Allegory of the Cave, or Plato's Cave, is an allegory
              presented by the Greek philosopher Plato in his work Republic
              (514a & 520a) to compare "the effect of education and the
              lack of it on our nature".

            <div class="description">
              It is written as a dialogue between Plato's brother Glaucon and his mentor Socrates, narrated by the latter. The allegory is presented after the analogy of the sun (508b&509c) and the analogy of the divided line (509d & 511e).

             In the allegory, Socrates describes a group of people who have lived chained to the wall of a cave all their lives, facing a blank wall. The people watch shadows projected on the wall from objects passing in front of a fire behind them and give names to these shadows. The shadows are the prisoners' reality, but are not accurate representations of the real world.

            <div class="description">
            Socrates explains how the philosopher is like a prisoner who is freed from the cave and comes to understand that the shadows on the wall are actually not reality at all. A philosopher aims to understand and perceive the higher levels of reality.  </div>
          </div>
           <div class="description">
          Three higher levels exist: the natural sciences; mathematics, geometry, and deductive logic; and the theory of forms. However, the other inmates of the cave do not even desire to leave their prison, for they know no better life.   </div>
