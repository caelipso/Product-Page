              In the allegory, Socrates describes a group of people who have
              lived chained to the wall of a cave all their lives, facing a
              blank wall.

            <div class="description">
              The people watch shadows projected on the wall from objects
              passing in front of a fire behind them and give names to these
              shadows. The shadows are the prisoners' reality, but are not
              accurate representations of the real world.

            <div class="description">
              Socrates explains how the philosopher is like a prisoner who is
              freed from the cave and comes to understand that the shadows on
              the wall are actually not reality at all. A philosopher aims to
              understand and perceive the higher levels of reality.

              Three higher levels exist: the natural sciences; mathematics,
              geometry, and deductive logic; and the theory of forms. However,
              the other inmates of the cave do not even desire to leave their
              prison, for they know no better life.

              Socrates remarks that this allegory can be paired with previous
              writings, namely the analogy of the sun and the analogy of the
              divided line.
